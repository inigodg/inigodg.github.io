                    Finally. Here it is. I've mustered up all of my memories of us and finally decided to write everything for you. It's been so long... here goes nothing. We had a good run, didn't we? All those sleepless nights talking to each other and sending each other sweet good night texts. Every morning that I would wake up feeling excited to check my notifications for your messages, all those times that I would take a deep breath, close my eyes, and just reflect on how happy it was to be alive at that moment. I wonder if you did the same...

                    A letter for one of my greatest loves. Where do I start? Well, I'm all grown up now. Would I want to go back to the past and stay there forever? Hell yeah. Reminiscing about you is both so relaxing and painful, but more of the latter. I love thinking about how simple life was back then. It helps me realize how far I've come and how fast I'm growing up.

                    I miss you so much that it hurts. All I had to worry about was going home as fast as I could just so I wouldn't miss iCarly on Nickelodeon or Spongebob, depending on the day. You were so beautiful and naive back then...
