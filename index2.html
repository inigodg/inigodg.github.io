                    Finally. Here it is. I've mustered up all of my memories of us and finally decided to write everything for you. It's been so long... here goes nothing. We had a good run, didn't we? All those sleepless nights talking to each other and sending each other sweet good night texts. Every morning that I would wake up feeling excited to check my notifications for your messages, all those times that I would take a deep breath, close my eyes, and just reflect on how happy it was to be alive at that moment. I wonder if you did the same...

                    How are you? It's been a while since we last talked. It was a bittersweet moment for me, knowing how much our experiences have led us both into very different paths. I would casually look at your profile to check on you and how you were doing with your new friends. You know what? Back in high school, I always found it very worrying to know that you were going to meet new people in college. You know how jealous I am. I put you on top. Any human being would be very lucky to have met you and seen your gorgeous smile that you were very insecure about. Ahhh, that smile. Your smile felt like sunrise on a rainy cold twilight. Like rest on a long Monday night. I felt like the luckiest guy. Side by side, we faced each day with something so precious yet uncertain. What I wouldn’t give to feel that once again. I used to like the fact that everything about us was so abrupt and uncertain. It gave me the feeling of being in an indie movie where the lead characters would just ride inside a long tunnel, arms up high, volume maxed. Now I despise how that backfired on me. I realized that the only thing that made us so uncertain was you. Maybe you had problems of your own, I don’t know. All I knew was something was different. Maybe you wanted something I couldn’t give.
